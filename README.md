To run this, simply clone this repo or download the zip and then run the index.html file.

The Lorenz attractor will begin to draw. (sig rho beta). You can use the '1,' '3,' and '5' keys respectively to increase the sigma, rho, beta parameters. Conversely, you can use the '2,', '4,' and '6' keys to reduce the respective parameters.

To reset the visualization entirely, press 'r.'
